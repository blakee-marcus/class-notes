# Most Viable Product

A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development. It is a strategy used by startups and companies to quickly validate their business idea with minimal risk and cost.

The idea behind an MVP is to create a basic version of the product that can be tested and validated with real customers. The product should have enough features to provide value to customers and allow them to solve a problem or fulfill a need. However, it should not include every possible feature or functionality that the product could eventually have.

By launching an MVP, companies can get feedback from early customers and use that feedback to make improvements and changes to the product. This iterative process allows the company to refine the product and ensure that it meets the needs and expectations of customers.

The MVP approach is also beneficial because it allows companies to launch their product quickly and with minimal investment. This can help to reduce the risk of failure and provide early revenue or traction for the company.
