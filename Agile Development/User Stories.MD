# User Stories

User stories are a way for software developers to understand what their users want and need. They are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality that a user would like to have in a software product.

The basic structure of a user story includes three parts:

1. The role or persona of the user
2. The goal or objective of the user
3. The benefit or value that the user will get from achieving that goal or objective

For example, a user story might look like this:
```
AS A marketing agency,   
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards  
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.
```
In this user story, the role or persona of the user is a marketing agency. Their goal or objective is to have a codebase that follows accessibility standards. The benefit or value they will get from achieving that goal is an optimized website for search engines.

The marketing agency is the user of this feature or functionality, and they have a specific need related to the quality of the codebase for their website. By using user stories like this, developers can understand the needs and requirements of the users and create software that meets those needs.

In an agile development process, this user story could be added to a backlog of other user stories and prioritized based on its importance to the marketing agency. The development team could then work on implementing the necessary changes to the codebase to meet the accessibility standards, ultimately delivering a more optimized website for search engines to the marketing agency.
