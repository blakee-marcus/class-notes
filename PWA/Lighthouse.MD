# Lighthouse

Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool developed by Google for improving the quality of web pages. It can be run as an extension in Google Chrome or from the command line. Lighthouse audits a web page for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO, and generates a report with suggestions for improvement. It can be useful for developers to improve the overall quality of their website and for SEO experts to identify potential issues that may be impacting search engine rankings.
