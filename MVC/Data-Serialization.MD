# Data Serialization #

The `.get({ plain: true })` method is used to retrieve a plain JavaScript object from a Sequelize model instance. A Sequelize model is a class that represents a table in a database. When you query a database using Sequelize, the resulting data is typically returned as a model instance.

The `plain` option, when set to `true`, tells Sequelize to return a plain JavaScript object instead of a model instance. This can be useful if you want to serialize the data and transmit it over a network connection or store it in a persistent storage.

Here's an example of how you might use the `.get({ plain: true })` method with Handlebars.js:

```javascript
const user = await User.findByPk(1); // Query the database for a user with id 1

const data = user.get({ plain: true }); // Convert the model instance into a plain JavaScript object
```
