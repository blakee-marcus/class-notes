# Validation in Sequelize #

In Sequelize, validation refers to the process of checking the data being stored in a database to ensure that it meets certain criteria. This can include checking for the presence of required fields, ensuring that data is of the correct data type, and enforcing certain constraints on the data (e.g., a field must be a certain length, a date must be in the future, etc.).

To perform validation in Sequelize, you can define validation rules for your models using the `validate` field in the model definition. For example:

```javascript
const User = sequelize.define('user', {
  username: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
    validate: {
      notEmpty: true,
      len: [5, 25]
    }
  },
  email: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
    unique: true,
    validate: {
      isEmail: true
    }
  },
  password: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
    validate: {
      len: [8, 100]
    }
  }
});
```

In this example, the `username` field is required (`allowNull: false`) and must not be empty (`notEmpty: true`) and must be between 5 and 25 characters long (`len: [5, 25]`). The email field is also required and must be a valid email address (`isEmail: true`), and the `password` field is required and must be between 8 and 100 characters long.

When you create or update a model instance, Sequelize will automatically validate the data based on the validation rules defined in the model. If any of the validation rules are violated, an error will be thrown and the operation will be cancelled.

You can also manually `validate` a model instance by calling the validate method on it. This will perform the validation checks and return a promise that resolves to an object containing the validation results.
