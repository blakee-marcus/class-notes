# Models #

In the `Sequelize` library, a model is a representation of a table in a database. Models allow you to query and manipulate data stored in a database by defining the structure of the table and the relationships between different tables.

Here's an example of a model definition in `Sequelize`:

```javascript
const User = sequelize.define('user', {
  name: Sequelize.STRING,
  email: Sequelize.STRING,
  password: Sequelize.STRING
});
```
This model represents a user table in the database with three columns: `name`, `email`, and `password`. The `Sequelize.STRING` type indicates that the values in these columns will be strings.

Once a model is defined, you can use it to perform various operations on the corresponding table in the database. For example, you can use the `create` method to insert a new row into the table:

```javascript
await User.create({
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  password: 'password'
});
```
You can also use the model's `findOne` method to retrieve a single row from the table:
```javascript
const user = await User.findOne({
  where: {
    email: 'john@example.com'
  }
});
```
Models can also be used to define relationships between different tables. For example, if you have a `posts` table that has a foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `users` table, you can define the relationship like this:
```javascript
User.hasMany(Post);
```
This will allow you to use the `User` model to retrieve all of the posts written by a particular user, or to retrieve the user who wrote a particular post.
