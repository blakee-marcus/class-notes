## Implementation of Client-Side POST Requests ##
***

In Express.js, you can implement client-side POST requests by making an HTTP POST request from the browser to the server. This can be done using the `fetch()` API in the browser, which provides an easy way to make HTTP requests and process the response.

Here is an example of how to use the `fetch()` API to make a POST request to an Express.js server:

```javascript
// Make POST request to /submit-form route
fetch('/submit-form', {
  method: 'POST', // Set request method to POST
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json' // Set Content-Type header
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    // Set request body
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'johndoe@example.com',
    message: 'Hello, world!'
  })
})
  .then(response => response.json()) // Parse JSON response
  .then(data => {
    // Use the response data
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle any errors
  })
```

In this example, the `fetch()` method is used to make a `POST` request to the `'/submit-form'` route on the server. The method option is set to POST to indicate that this is a `POST` request, and the headers option is used to set the Content-Type header to application/json. The body option is used to set the request body, which in this case is a JSON object containing the form data.

The `response.json()` method is used to parse the JSON response from the server, and the `.then()` and `.catch()` methods are used to handle the successful response and any errors, respectively.

## Client-Side POST Requests w/ Async ##

Alternatively, you can use the async/await syntax to make the code look more synchronous and easier to read:

```javascript
// Make POST request to /submit-form route
const submitForm = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/submit-form', {
      method: 'POST', // Set request method to POST
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json' // Set Content-Type header
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        // Set request body
        name: 'John Doe',
        email: 'johndoe@example.com',
        message: 'Hello, world!'
      })
    })
    const data = await response.json() // Parse JSON response
    // Use the response data
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors
  }
}
```

In this example, the async/await syntax is used to make the code look more like synchronous code. The try/catch block is used to handle any errors that may occur during the request, and the await keyword is used to wait for the `fetch()` and `response.json()` methods to complete before continuing with the code.
