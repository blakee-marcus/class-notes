## ðŸ“– Implement Middleware for Static Assets ##
***
To implement middleware for static assets in Express.js, you can use the `express.static()` middleware function. This function allows you to serve static files, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript, from a specific directory in your application.  


Here is an example of how to use the `express.static()` middleware to serve static assets from the public directory in your application:

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

// Serve static files from the 'public' directory
app.use(express.static('public'))
```

In this example, the `app.use()` method is used to add the ``express.static()`` middleware to the application. The `express.static()` function is passed the path to the public directory, which is where the static assets are stored.
***
Once this middleware is in place, any request for a static asset in the public directory will be handled by the middleware and the corresponding file will be served to the client. For example, if the public directory contains an image file named `'logo.png'`, a request for `'/logo.png'` would serve that file to the client.

* Note that the `express.static()` middleware must be added to the application before any routes that may match static assets. This is because the middleware will handle the request for the static asset and prevent the route handlers from executing.
