## Implement Modular Routes ##

In Express.js, modular routing refers to the practice of separating the route handlers for different parts of an application into separate files or modules. This allows you to organize your route handlers in a more maintainable and scalable way, as well as reuse them across different parts of the application.

To implement modular routing in Express.js, you can create a separate file or module for each group of related route handlers and export the routes from these files or modules. Then, in the main application file, you can import these routes and use the `app.use()` method to add them to the application.

Here is an example of how to create separate files for different groups of routes and import them into the main application file:

```javascript
// users.js
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()

// Add route handlers for /users routes
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Handle GET request to /users
})
router.post('/', (req, res) => {
  // Handle POST request to /users
})

module.exports = router
```
```javascript
// posts.js
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()

// Add route handlers for /posts routes
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
```
To import the routes from the `users.js` and `posts.js` files into the main application file, you can use the `require()` function and the `app.use()` method:

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

// Import routes
const usersRoutes = require('./users')
const postsRoutes = require('./posts')

// Use imported routes
app.use('/users', usersRoutes)
app.use('/posts', postsRoutes)
```

In this example, the `require()` function is used to import the `usersRoutes` and `postsRoutes` variables from the `users.js` and `posts.js` files, respectively. These variables contain the route handlers for the `'/users'` and `'/posts'` routes, as defined in those files.

The `app.use()` method is then used to add these routes to the application. The `app.use()` method takes two arguments: the base path for the routes and the imported route variable. In this example, the `'/users'` and `'/posts'` routes are added to the application with the usersRoutes and postsRoutes variables, respectively.

Once the routes are imported and added to the application, any requests to the `'/users'` and `'/posts'` routes will be handled by the corresponding route handlers. For example, a `GET` request to `'/users'` will be handled by the route handler defined in the `users.js` file.

## What does module.exports do? ##

In JavaScript, module.exports is a special object that is used to expose variables and functions to other modules. It is a property of the module object, which is a global object that represents the current module in a Node.js application.

When you want to make a variable or function available to other modules in a Node.js application, you can assign it to module.exports. For example, you can use the following code to expose a greeting variable and a hello function:

```javascript
// Define the greeting and hello variables and functions
const greeting = 'Hello, world!';
const hello = () => {
  console.log(greeting);
};

// Expose the greeting and hello variables and functions to other modules
module.exports = {
  greeting,
  hello,
};
```
In this code, the greeting variable and the hello function are defined and then assigned to module.exports as properties. This makes them available to other modules, which can import and use them using the `require()` function.

For example, another module can import and use the greeting and hello functions like this:

```javascript
// Import the greeting and hello functions from the other module
const { greeting, hello } = require('./other-module');

// Use the greeting and hello functions
console.log(greeting); // logs "Hello, world!"
hello(); // logs "Hello, world!"
```
In this code, the `require()` function is used to import the greeting and hello functions from the other module. These functions are then used in the current module.
