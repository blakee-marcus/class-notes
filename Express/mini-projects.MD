## Create a wildcard route that will send the users to a 404 page ##

To create a wildcard route that sends users to a 404 page in Express.js, you can use the * character in the route path. This will match any request that is not matched by any other routes in your application, and send the request to the route handler for the wildcard route.

Here is an example of how to create a wildcard route that sends users to a 404 page in Express.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

// Add route handlers for other routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Handle GET request to /
})

// Add wildcard route
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  // Handle requests to any other routes
  // Send 404 page
  res.status(404).send('404 - Page not found')
})
```
In this example, the `app.get()` method is used to add a route handler for the wildcard route. This route handler will be called whenever a request is made to a route that is not matched by any other routes in the application.

In the route handler for the wildcard route, the `res.status()` and `res.send()` methods are used to set the HTTP status code to 404 (Not Found) and send a "404 - Page not found" message as the response. This will send the user to a 404 page and display the error message to inform them that the requested page was not found.

You can also customize the wildcard route and the 404 page by using different route paths and response data. For example, you can use a different HTTP status code, such as 400 (Bad Request) or 500 (Internal Server Error), or send a custom response message or HTML page as the response.
