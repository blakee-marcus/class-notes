## What is MVC? ##

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, and it is a software design pattern that separates the application logic, presentation, and data into three interconnected components. The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. The View is responsible for rendering the user interface, and the Controller handles the user input and communicates with the Model and View. The MVC pattern helps developers create applications that are easier to maintain and expand, as it separates the different concerns of the application into distinct components.

## What is Handlebars JS? ##

Handlebars.js is a JavaScript library that provides an easy way to create and render templates. It allows developers to create templates with placeholders for data, and then populate the placeholders with actual data at runtime. This makes it easy to create dynamic, data-driven web applications without having to manually build HTML strings. Handlebars.js uses a syntax similar to HTML, which makes it easy for developers to learn and use.

## What is Data Serialization? ##

Data serialization is the process of converting data structures or objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted over a network. The serialized data can then be converted back into its original format, which is known as deserialization. Data serialization is useful for storing data in a persistent storage or for transmitting data over a network connection. There are many different formats for serializing data, including JSON, XML, and CSV.
