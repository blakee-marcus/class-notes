## How do you create a database in MySQL? ##

use the `CREATE DATABASE` command to create a new database, specifying the name of the database after the command. For example:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_database;
```

## How do you create a table? ##

To create a table in the database, you can use the `CREATE TABLE` command. This command allows you to specify the name of the table, as well as the names and data types of the columns in the table. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

## What are 3 different MySQL data types? ##

Some common MySQL data types include:

* `INT`: Stores integer values.
* `VARCHAR`: Stores variable-length character strings.
* `DATE`: Stores date and time values.

## How do you add data to a MySQL table? ##

To add data to a MySQL table, you can use the `INSERT INTO` command. This command allows you to specify the name of the table, as well as the values you want to insert into the table. For example:

```sql
INSERT INTO my_table (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com');
```
You can also use the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands to modify or remove data from a MySQL table. It's important to note that these operations can be dangerous if not used carefully, as they can permanently alter or remove data from your database. It's always a good idea to back up your data before making any changes to your database.
