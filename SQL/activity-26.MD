## Implement Join Clause to Combine Two Tables ##

To use a `JOIN` clause to combine two tables in a MySQL query, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column
```

In this syntax, the `SELECT` statement specifies the columns that you want to retrieve from the two tables. The `FROM` clause specifies the two tables that you want to combine, and the `JOIN` clause specifies how the tables should be combined. The `ON` clause specifies the condition that determines which rows from the two tables should be included in the result set.

For example, suppose you have two tables called `users` and `posts`, and each `post` has a `user_id` column that specifies the `id` of the user who created the post. To combine these tables and retrieve all posts along with the user who created each post, you could use the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
JOIN posts
ON users.id = posts.user_id
```

This query would combine the users and posts tables and return a result set with one row for each post, along with the name and email of the user who created the post.

Note that there are several different types of `JOIN` clauses that you can use in MySQL, including `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`, each of which has its own specific behavior and uses. For more information, you can refer to the MySQL documentation.
