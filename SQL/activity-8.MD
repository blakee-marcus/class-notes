## SQL Insert ##

The `INSERT` statement in SQL is used to add new rows of data to a table in a database. The `INSERT` statement allows you to specify the table and the columns you want to insert data into, as well as the values for each column.

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, name, email) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com');
```

In this example, the `INSERT` statement is adding a new row to the users table, with the values `'1'`, `'John Doe'`, and `'johndoe@example.com'` for the id, name, and email columns, respectively.

The `INSERT` statement is a powerful and flexible way to add data to a table in a database. You can use it to add a single row at a time, or to add multiple rows in a single statement. You can also use it to add data to only specific columns in a table, or to insert data into a table that has a different structure than the data you are inserting.
