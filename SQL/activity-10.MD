## SQL Delete ##

To delete data from a table in SQL, you can use the `DELETE` statement. This statement allows you to specify the table and the rows that you want to delete. For example, the following `DELETE` statement will delete all rows from the users table:

```sql
DELETE FROM users;
```

If you want to delete only specific rows, you can use the `WHERE` clause to specify a condition. For example, the following `DELETE` statement will delete only the rows from the users table where the id column is equal to 1:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

It's important to note that the `DELETE` statement is a powerful and potentially dangerous operation. Once you delete data from a table, it cannot be recovered, so it's important to use it carefully and make sure you have a backup of your data before making any changes to your database.
